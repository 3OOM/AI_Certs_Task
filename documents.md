# **Sentiment Analysis API with LLM Integration**

## 1. Approach to Solving the Problem

### 1.1 API Development
- **Framework**: Chose Flask as the web framework for its simplicity and ease of use.
- **Endpoint**: Implemented a single endpoint `/analyze` that accepts POST requests with file uploads.
- **File Handling**: Used pandas to handle both CSV and XLSX file formats.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrated with the Groq API for sentiment analysis using their LLM capabilities.

### 1.2 File Processing
- **Review Extraction**: Extracted review text from the 'Review' column of the uploaded file.
- **Limitations**: Limited analysis to 50 reviews to meet requirements and manage API usage efficiently.

### 1.3 Sentiment Analysis
- **LLM API**: Utilized Groq's LLM API to perform sentiment analysis.
- **Classification**: The model classifies sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Aggregation**: Processed each review individually and aggregated the sentiment results.

### 1.4 Error Handling
- **File Validation**: Implemented checks for file presence, format, and the existence of required columns.
- **API Error Logging**: Added error logging to capture and address API request failures.

## 2. Implementation of Structured Response

The API returns a JSON response in the following format:

```json
{
    "negative": 13,
    "neutral": 0,
    "positive": 22
}
```

This was implemented by:
- **Sentiment Counting**: Counting the occurrences of each sentiment category.
- **Response Construction**: Constructing a dictionary with the sentiment counts.
- **Response Conversion**: Using Flask's `jsonify` function to convert the dictionary to a JSON response.

## 3. Examples of API Usage

### 3.1 Sample Input

A CSV file containing customer reviews:

```plaintext
Review
"This product exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended!"
"The quality was poor and it broke after a week. Disappointed."
"It's okay, nothing special but does the job."
```

### 3.2 API Request
Using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST -F 'file=@/path/to/customer_reviews.csv' http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze
```

### 3.3 Sample Output

```json
{
    "negative": 1,
    "neutral": 1,
    "positive": 1
}
```

## 4. Analysis of Results

### 4.1 Accuracy
- **Context Awareness**: The LLM-based approach provides nuanced sentiment analysis.
- **Understanding Subtlety**: Capable of understanding context and subtle expressions in customer reviews.

### 4.2 Limitations
- **Review Limit**: Limited to 50 reviews per request due to API constraints.
- **API Dependency**: Dependent on the quality and consistency of the Groq API for performance.
- **Sentiment Complexity**: May struggle with detecting sarcasm or more complex sentiments.

### 4.3 Potential Improvements
- **Batch Processing**: Implement batch processing for larger datasets.
- **Granular Classification**: Add more granular sentiment categories (e.g., very positive, slightly negative).
- **Confidence Scores**: Incorporate confidence scores for each sentiment classification.
- **Caching**: Implement caching to reduce API calls for repeated reviews.

## 5. Additional Insights and Observations
- **LLM Flexibility**: The use of an LLM for sentiment analysis offers flexibility but may be slower than traditional machine learning models.
- **Prompt Engineering**: The performance of the system is highly dependent on prompt engineering for the LLM.
- **Performance Trade-offs**: There is a trade-off between the number of reviews processed and API response time.
- **Uniform Processing**: The current implementation treats all reviews equally, regardless of their length or complexity.

## 6. Conclusion

This sentiment analysis API demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs into traditional NLP tasks. While it provides robust and context-aware sentiment analysis, there are opportunities for optimization and expansion, such as handling larger datasets and offering more detailed insights.
